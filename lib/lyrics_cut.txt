I am the son
And the heir
Of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
I am the son and heir
Of nothing in particular
You shut your mouth
How can you say
I go about things the wrong way
I am human and I need to be loved
Just like everybody else does
There's a club if you'd like to go
You could meet somebody who really loves you
So you go home
you stand on your own
you leave on your own
you go home and you cry
you want to die
When you say it's gonna happen "now"
Well when exactly do you mean
See I've already waited too long
And all my hope is gone
