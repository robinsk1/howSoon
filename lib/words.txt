i am the son
the heir
of a shyness
criminally
vulgar
nothing in particular
shut your mouth
How can you say
wrong way
i am human
i need to be loved
like everybody else does
there's a club
if you'd like to go
loves you
you go
on your own
go home
cry
want to die
now
when exactly
too long
my hope is gone
